# Doxygen-Assignment

This is the upload for my doxygen assignment. Everything went fairly well once I was in the lab and had to switch between the actual linux terminal and the terminal I was SSH'ed
into. The only problem I ran into was the last part of the assignment about documenting everything. Everything was already kind of documented, so I just simply ran file-doq on all of them so they 
would show up in the doxygen file, but I was confused about the clarity and scope of the comments we should add ourselves. Other than that, everything is here and worked properly.

Also added some test comments to Employee.cpp to see if doxygen would pick any of it up.

Now also did more testing for running class-doq on all the classes.
